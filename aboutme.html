    <h2>Savanna Whittaker</h2>
    <h4>Hi! I'm Savanna and I'm from Washougal, Wa! I'm majoring in Software Engineering with an emphasis in Full Stack Development.
        I'm a sophomore currently and I'm living in Rexburg right now! Over break I did a python project with Spotify API to make a program 
        that will save my discover weekly playlists into one giant one. I'm excited to see what else I'll be able to do with HTML and CSS. 
        I enjoy reading and watching tv shows (I watch a lot of Judge Judy). My Husband and I want to move to Utah after graduating and 
        he can attend law school while I work in tech.
